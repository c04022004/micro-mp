## Multi-purpose Arduino Micro shield

This is an attempt stuff functionalities onto an ATmega32U4-based board while keeping a moderate footprint and simple low-cost parts. The original version is made out of the necessity to replace dupont(jumper) wires for stability. The board gradually expanded into the current form. This is also my first few PCBs, so expect it to be less than optimal. I learnt a lot going through the design, soldering, debug process and enjoyed working on it.
